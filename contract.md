# Contrat Mentor Mentored

## We both would like

The mentoring session are based on volunteership, each party can stop the session whenever they decide so.
I would like from you, honesty and kindness

## Now I am your mentored

I would like from you, the same help that you gave to your other mentored

I would like from you, that nothing we talk about in our mentoring session moves out of our session

I will speak to you of what is hurting me, you will know things that are pushing me to my boundaries, and I would like to keep it between us, and not goes out.

I would like from you, to not use the information you know about me, in order to undermine me, or to favorise someone else.

I understand that your here to help me, and that I need to be truthfull to you in order you to be able to help me.

I would like from you, to help me grow be a better me, not a different me.

## Now that I am your mentor

I would like from you, to try your best to improve yourself.

I would like from you, to be truthfull, in order for me to be able to help you.

I would like from you, to not await from me to solve your problem. However I will help you find your way to solve your problems. Only you can solve your problem. Solving problem for you would not help you with your problem, it would only help you being block by the same problem faster!

I would like from you, to ask for help as soon as possible. Don't wait it to be too late otherwise we won't have time to find a suitable solution.

I would like from you, to not wait magic, there's no magic, only humans will to grow together.

I would like from you, to be able to trust me.

I would like from you, to tell me your feeling about the advises I may give, if it's not suitable for you at the present moment. So that we can work together to solve the blockage step by step.

I would like from you, to not put pressure on me about other circumstance in the company. The mentoring sessions are there to help you gain in seniority not to handle management problems.
